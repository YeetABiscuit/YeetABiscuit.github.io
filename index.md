# Brent Tran-Phu's Portfolio

I am currently enrolling in CSUF as a computer science major and will be expecting to graduate around 2029-2030 depending on how many classes I take per semester.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 8, Part-2
My favorite portion of the lab is part two since it frequently goes into further detail about the ideas covered in part one. It's where we get to put everything we've learned into practice in a more intricate or realistic setting. I find Part 2 to be very interesting since it usually requires creativity, experimentation, and problem-solving. It feels like the conclusion of everything we've done thus far, and taking on more difficult jobs gives us a sense of success. It's also a chance to investigate novel concepts and extend the limits of our comprehension. All in all, the real fun starts in lab part two!

Lab 2
My favorite lab is number 02 since it covers the foundational ideas of C++ text manipulation and user input. For those who are new to the software, it's an excellent place to start learning how to interact with it dynamically through input. It also establishes the foundation for more intricate applications including data processing and user interaction. Furthermore, it's always nice to see results right away that are dependent on the user's inputs. All things considered, Lab 02 is an interesting and fundamental experience as it is the starting point for the adventure into interactive programming.

Lab 7
My favorite lab is number 07 since it uses programming to solve real-world problems. It depicts a situation in real life where we must decide if parking is permitted on certain streets during particular hours. Understanding of functions, conditions, and data management is necessary for this lab. It also requires using header files to create a modular framework, which is a good approach for organizing code in larger projects. All things considered, Lab 07 gives us a practical way to apply programming concepts and gets us ready for increasingly difficult software development projects.
